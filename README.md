# unifinder

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Elevator Pitch
Every year, highschool seniors rush to research university programs, only to find minimal information on where they’ll be spending the next 4 years. To solve this problem, we have developed UniFinder

* About the project

## Inspiration

Our entire team is struggling/struggled with university applications, and realized that a lot of our problems relating to program research, deadlines and lack of advice could be easily solved with an app.

## What it does

UniFinder allows users to search by program or university to find potential university programs, and get all the information they need for said program. Additionally, users may add their interests and point grade averages to get recommended suitable programs for them, while also getting in app news for universities doing cool things in their interested fields. 

## How we built it
Developed IOS application using flutter SDK with firebase backend (authentication, database, analytics) 

## Challenges we ran into
Ironically, the hardest part of developing UniFinder wasn’t even the coding, it was setting up Firebase in a flutter project . There were issues with cocoapods that took quite a while to solve, but after watching multiple video tutorials our development went rather smoothly.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of

Developed a helpful idea and implemented it into a mobile app that looks and works smoothly.

## What we learned
That following tutorials and online documentation won’t always work as expected. A lot of individual research 

## What's next for UniFinder

UniFinder still needs polishing, with many features such as in app messaging and user facilitation ideas (uploading grades to find potential programs e.t.c) among concepts that we have in mind. The design can still be improved as well, in order to give users their information as fast and as efficiently as possible.
